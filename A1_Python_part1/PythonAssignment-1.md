## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans: As python is a human readable langauge, that's why we call pyhton as high level language and it is called general purpose language as it is being used in many domains such as AI, Web Dev, Data Engineering, Data Analysis etc..

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans: Python is a dynamically typed language as we don't have to declare the type of variable while assigning a value to a variable.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans: Pros:
        Beginner-friendly	
        Large Community	
        Flexible and Extensible	
        Extensive Libraries	
        Embeddable	
        Highly Scalable	
        IoT Opportunities	
        Portable
    Cons:
        Slower than compiled languages
        High memory consumption
        Complex multithreading

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans: Python is a language which is being used in multiple domains such as Data Engineering, Web development, Data Analysis, Data Science, ML etc.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans: variables are the names give to the memory location where data is stored in the memory.

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans: Using the input() function.

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans: String.

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans: Changing the datatype of a variable is called the type casting.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans: We can't take more than one input as the input is in the form of string. But one thing we can definitely do is to split the given string and typecast it accordingly.
Example:
input is 'sahil bhatia has completed assignment'
str_list = input('Enter the string:').split(' ')
output will be: ['sahil', 'bhatia', 'has', 'completed', 'assignment']

Q10. What are keywords?
Ans: Keywords are the predefined words in any language. E.g. and, or, if, else, for, while etc.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans: Keywords 

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans: Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans: Using the print function.

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans: In Python, operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed. The values that an operator acts on are called operands.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans: / is the float divisor and // is the int divisor.

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans: and, or, not are called boolean operator.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

Ans: 1 or 0 -> 1 
    0 and 0 -> 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans: These are called coditional statements and used as decision making statements.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
